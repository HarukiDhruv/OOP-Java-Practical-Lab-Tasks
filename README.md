## Module 1: Fundamentals & Basic Programming

This module covers the initial setup of a Java development environment and the fundamentals of Java programming. The objective is to write, compile, and run basic programs while understanding primitive data types, variables, and operators.

### Programs Created

**`HelloWorld.java`**: A simple program to verify the development environment by printing "Hello, World!" and a welcome message to the console.
**`DataTypesDemo.java`**: A program that declares, initializes, and prints variables for all of Java's primitive data types.This also includes the optional task to perform simple arithmetic and logical operations.

### Key Concepts

**Environment Setup**: Installed the Java Development Kit (JDK) and configured the `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` environment variables.
**Compilation & Execution**: Used the command line to compile (`javac`) and run (`java`) Java applications.
**Data Types**: Demonstrated the use of all 8 primitive data types (`byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`).
**Operators**: Applied basic arithmetic (`+`) and logical (`&&`) operators.
**Version Control**: Used Git to track project history and upload files to GitHub.

## How to Run

1.  Navigate to the directory containing the source files (e.g., `Task-1`).
2.  Compile the desired Java file using the Java compiler:
    ```bash
    javac FileName.java
    ```
3.  Run the compiled program using the Java Virtual Machine:
    ```bash
    java FileName
    ```
